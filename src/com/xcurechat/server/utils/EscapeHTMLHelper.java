	 * Replaces characters that may be confused by a HTML
	 * parser with their equivalent character entity references.
	 * <p>
	 * Any data that will appear as text on a web page should
	 * be be escaped.  This is especially important for data
	 * that comes from untrusted sources such as Internet users.
	 * A common mistake in CGI programming is to ask a user for
	 * data and then put that data on a web page.  For example:<pre>
	 * Server: What is your name?
	 * User: &lt;b&gt;Joe&lt;b&gt;
	 * Server: Hello <b>Joe</b>, Welcome</pre>
	 * If the name is put on the page without checking that it doesn't
	 * contain HTML code or without sanitizing that HTML code, the user
	 * could reformat the page, insert scripts, and control the the
	 * content on your web server.
	 * <p>
	 * This method will replace HTML characters such as &gt; with their
	 * HTML entity reference (&amp;gt;) so that the html parser will
	 * be sure to interpret them as plain text rather than HTML or script.
	 * <p>
	 * This method should be used for both data to be displayed in text
	 * in the html document, and data put in form elements. For example:<br>
	 * <code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<i>This in not a &amp;lt;tag&amp;gt;
	 * in HTML</i>&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code><br>
	 * and<br>
	 * <code>&lt;form&gt;&lt;input type="hidden" name="date" value="<i>This data could
	 * be &amp;quot;malicious&amp;quot;</i>"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</code><br>
	 * In the second example, the form data would be properly be resubmitted
	 * to your cgi script in the URLEncoded format:<br>
	 * <code><i>This data could be %22malicious%22</i></code>
	 *
	 * @param s String to be escaped
	 * @return escaped String
	 * @throws NullPointerException if s is null.
